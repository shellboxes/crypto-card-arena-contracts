# CryptoCardArena - A Blockchain Game Built with Solidity
​
## Overview
​
CryptoCardArena is a competitive, peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain game built with Solidity. It consists of three main components - the card, the game, and a consumer contract. This decentralized game uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as in-game assets (cards), and allows players to compete in a P2P manner. The winner of the game is determined by a random number generated using Chainlink VRF.
​
## Contract Overview
​
1. **Card Contract (CryptoCard.sol):** This contract implements the core functionality of the in-game assets, the cards. It uses the ERC721 standard to create unique tokens (cards) that can be owned and transferred by players.
​
2. **Game Contract (CryptoCardGame.sol):** This contract handles the game logic, including creating new games, joining games, and determining the winner. It uses the Card contract to interact with the cards.
​
3. **CryptoCardArena Contract (CryptoCardArena.sol):** This contract handles the minting logic of the NFT cards. It requests a random number from Chainlink VRF which is used to determine the card minted for the user. The cost to mint a card is dynamically determined using a Chainlink price feed.
​
## Features
​
- Users can mint unique cards which are NFTs
- The card details and attributes are stored on the blockchain
- Users can use their cards to join a game
- Games are played in a P2P manner
- The winner of the game is determined based on a random number generated by Chainlink VRF
- The winner of the game gets rewarded
​
## Dependencies
​
- Solidity v0.8.19
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Chainlink Contracts
​
## Installation
​
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Compile the contracts using `npx hardhat compile`
4. Deploy the arena contract using `npx hardhat run scripts/deployarena.js --network Nt_Name`
5. Deploy the game contract using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network Nt_Name`
​6. Verify contracts `npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network Nt_Name`

## Testing
​
To run the tests, use the `npx hardhat test` command.

## Chainlink services

- The Chainlink Price Feeds service provides accurate and up-to-date price data for a wide range of cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, and financial instruments. It serves as a crucial component for DeFi applications that require real-time price information to execute smart contract logic and facilitate secure and transparent transactions.
for that we used  this service in the `CryptoCardArena.sol` smart contract to have the Wei value of ethers value in the function `getMintPriceValue()` 

- The Second chainlink service used is Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. 
for that we used this service to generate the card Id that is stored in cloud this service is used in the `mintCard()` function
